# i3-10105F-GTX-970-B460M-Sonoma-Hackintosh
OpenCore + Comet Lake i3 10105F + NVIDIA GTX 970 is a very non-standard build for hackintosh.
After going through a lot of forums and trying more than one system, by the end I was desperate and thought that nothing would work. But now I can say that this preset works **(although the Opencore Guide says that it does not work)**, the patcher started only on Sonoma and that, only after the update from Big Sur **(on Big Sur was a problem with the patcher, he patched it crookedly and had to update)**, now the driver works stably outputs 144Hz on FullHD monitor otherwise the system works stable all the effects of transparency work, animations smooth.

The config may not be perfect because I am in this field for the first time, but in spite of that I tried to clean it up as much as possible. The sound driver works, the usb bluetooth module also started, but does not want to search for devices **(judging by the forums after Monterey, Apple completely killed USB Dongles)** If anyone knows a solution how to fix it I am waiting for feedback. 

Thanks to the creators of [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg).
